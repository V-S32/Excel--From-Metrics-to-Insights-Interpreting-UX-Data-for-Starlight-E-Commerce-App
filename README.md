## Project Overview
This analysis explores the user journey within Starlightâ€™s mobile shopping app, from initial landing on the home screen to completing a purchase. Using Excel to assess both quantitative and qualitative metrics, the study aims to uncover patterns, identify challenges, and generate actionable insights to improve the shopping experience, boost engagement and customer retention, and drive overall business performance.

## Dataset Overview
The analysis utilizes three key tables:
1. **User Feedback**  : This table provides detailed insights into individual user sessions, capturing session duration, product engagement, cart activity, and checkout progress to better understand user behavior in the app.
2. **App Analytics Data**:This table captures key app usage metrics at the session level, tracking user activity, engagement, and conversion behavior within the mobile shopping app.
3. **User Behavior Data**: This table compiles qualitative user input to help assess satisfaction and uncover opportunities for improvement.

## Key Insights
1. **App Analytics**: An analysis of the app's performance from 2020 to 2022 reveals a notable decline in key metrics. The "Trend of Average Bounce and Conversion Rates by Year" chart shows a consistent decrease in the average conversion rate alongside an increase in the average bounce rate over the three-year period.
2. **User Behavior**:
  * Peak Usage: User activity on the app peaks at two primary times: 1:00 AM and 8:00 PM (20:00).
  * Cart Conversion: There is a strong correlation between the number of items in a user's cart and the likelihood of a sale. Carts with a higher quantity of items convert to a sale 50% of the time.
3. **Actionable User Feedback**:
Direct user feedback highlighted critical areas for improvement:
  * The most common piece of feedback from users is that the checkout process needs improvement.
  * A significant number of users have reported that the app's search feature is not working correctly.

## Conclusion
This project highlights how Excel can transform raw data into actionable insights for business growth.
